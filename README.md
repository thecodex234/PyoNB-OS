# PyoNB-OS
PyoNB-OS (p-ee-onb-oh-ess) stands for Python Notebook Operating System. It's exactly what it sounds like, an Operating System made in a Jupyter Notebook. It's still heavily WIP, but (I think) it's coming along nicely.
## Features
---
### .txt file writing
It can read and write .txt files. This is especially good for your essays. I'm still working on how indents work, but for now, it works amazingly. <br>
### Chats and Contacts
This is a current WIP. The contacts book works great, but the chats are still being worked on. It doesn't exactly work for now, you'll have to convert the file to a .py file if you want it to work. <br>
### HTML Browser
Using BeautifulSoup, enter any web address (needs to have https://) and the HTML version of it will pop out. I'm still working on how newlines and search engines will work, but for now it works fine otherwise. <br>
